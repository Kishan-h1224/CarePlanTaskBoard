## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The application follows a modular, unidirectional data flow pattern designed for resilience.

### Core Modules
-   **UI Layer**: Next.js App Router with ShadCN UI components. Highly interactive and responsive.
-   **State Management**: Zustand handles global state, including patient lists, tasks, and filtering. It implements the **Optimistic UI** pattern.
-   **Mock API Layer**: Located in `src/lib/api-client.ts`. Simulates network latency (500ms+) and connectivity failures to test system robustness.
-   **Data Contracts**: Zod schemas in `src/types/index.ts` provide runtime validation and safe defaults, handling "intentional ambiguity" from the backend.
-   **AI Integration**: Genkit flows generate clinical task descriptions using Google Gemini 2.5 Flash.

## ⚖️ Assumptions & Trade-offs

### Assumptions
-   **Local-First UI**: The UI assumes the local state update will likely succeed, providing instant feedback.
-   **Role-Based Access**: While roles (Nurse, Dietician, etc.) are implemented for filtering, full RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) is assumed to be handled by a parent system.
-   **Clinical Context**: Task descriptions generated by AI are meant as drafts for clinical staff review.

### Trade-offs
-   **Mock Persistence**: Data is stored in-memory in the Zustand store. Refreshing the browser resets data to mocks. This was chosen to prioritize prototyping the "Failure Modes" logic over database integration.
-   **Simplified Patient List**: The list of patients is static to focus the exercise on the complex task management logic.

## 🚩 Known Limitations & Next Steps

### Limitations
-   **No Persistence**: Changes do not persist across sessions.
-   **Single User**: No authentication or user-specific task assignments are implemented.
-   **Static Filtering**: Filters are client-side only.

### Next Steps
1.  **Persistence**: Integrate Firebase Firestore or a PostgreSQL database for real-time, persistent storage.
2.  **Drag & Drop**: Implement `dnd-kit` or `react-beautiful-dnd` to allow moving tasks between columns visually.
3.  **Real-time Updates**: Use WebSockets or Firestore listeners to allow multiple staff members to see task updates live.
4.  **Auth & RBAC**: Integrate Firebase Auth and implement strict role-based views.
5.  **Offline Support**: Implement Service Workers and IndexedDB for true offline-first capability.
